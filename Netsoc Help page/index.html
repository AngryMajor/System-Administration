    <h2><a name="access">
    Accessing the server
    </a></h2>
    *(setup/access account info)
    
    <p>

    To administer your account on the server, you need to log in using SSH (Secure shell)<br/>

    An SSH client should be available by default on Mac and Linux. <br/>
    It might already be available on Windows, but if not, we recommend using the Putty SSH client.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To connect to the server, open a terminal/console and type:<br/>
    <div class="code">
    >> ssh username@netsoc.ucd.ie
    </div>
    <br/>
    You should now be prompted for your password.

    <div class="code">
    >> username@netsoc.ucd.ie's password:
    </div>
    <br/>
    (Don't worry if it's not displaying anything as you type in your password. That's how it's supposed to work)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    
    If you're using Putty, just open the program and fill in the blanks>
    </p>

    <h2><a  name="webpage">
    Setting up your webpage
    </a></h2>

    <p>
    To set up a basic webpage, simply add a file called index.html to the www/ folder in your home directory on the server. The contents of that index.html file will then be displayed with the address netsoc.ucd.ie/~username 
    </p>
    <p>
    To create a nice website, you can use whichever framework you want! Or you could open up your favourite text editor and W3schools’s Into to HTML and CSS, and start coding away! 
    </p>
    <p>
    If there are features you want on your website that we currently don’t support, please tell us and we’ll do our best to accommodate you. 
    </p>



    <h2><a  name="upload">
    Uploading files
    </a></h2>
    <p>
    Here are a few simple ways to get your files from your computer to your server. In these examples, I'll send a file called index.html to the folder /www/ in my home directory on the server.

    </p>
    <p>
    Most SSH clients support SFTP(SSH File Transfer Protocol), which allows you to use the terminal/console to send files to the server. 
    </p>



    <p>
    If you just want to send a single file to the server, you can use:
    <div class="code">
    >> scp index.html username@netsoc.ucd.ie:www/
    </div>
    </p>


    <p>
    If you want to transfer multiple files, you could use SFTP in the terminal, but we recommend using a client like FileZilla in this case. (Remember to avoid installing Bing search and Opera when downloading FileZilla) <br/> 
    Here's a simple introduction to FileZilla.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    Connect to the netsoc.ucd.ie server with your username and password. Remember to set the port to 22 (to use SFTP).
    </p>
    <img src="FileZillaLogin.png"/>
    <p> 
    The window on the right displays your current folder on the server(top) and the contents of that folder(bottom). 
    </p>
    <img src="FileZillaServerFiles.png"/>
    <p>
    You can navigate using the top window to find the location where you want to upload a file then either find your file in the left window or in a separate file explorer and drag it to somewhere in the right window. Your file should now be uploaded to the server in the location you dragged it to.
